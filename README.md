# Happy Thoughts project w7

This week's task was to work with useEffect to call an API, then use POST-requests to display and add new thoughts/likes to a list of happy thoughts, a page that can receive new post and display recent posts..
## The problem

I started to get the example project to function with the temporary API, had some difficulties with date-fns and a few thing in the eslint file, But managed after some help. After that I changed the API fetch and the components name to suit the project. Then I whent over the props and started to replace to the "correct" ones, using Postman to display the Array. 
With the given design I used a scatchpad to structure and naming the different components/tags so that the CSS-part would be much easyer. It helpde but I have to continue working on the structure of my components =)

If I'd had more time I would try to get the character counter to display in the color red when, les then 4 or 140 caracters where used, to visualize this step. I would also try to extract the button as it's own component probobly also make a specific button css file.
